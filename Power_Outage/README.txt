Power Outage - Interaction Instructions

The objective of the game is to turn on the city's power. In order to do so, the player must locate the key to the main building. Once the key is located, the player can pick it up and proceed to insert it into the keyhole next to the door of the main building.

To help facilitate finding the key, the player can utilize the four colored portals, each of which teleports the player into roughly the middle of the respective colored city-quadrant. If the player gets lost, they can teleport back to spawn whenever they like or just walk back. If you have trouble finding the key, the coordinates of the key are noted at the bottom of this page.
